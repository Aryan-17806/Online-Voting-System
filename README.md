# Online Voting System | Java, JDBC, Object-Oriented Programming

## Description
Developed a secure and scalable **Online Voting System** using **Java** and **JDBC** for database connectivity. Applied **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** — Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction — to design modular and reusable code. Enabled **voter registration, authentication, and vote casting** functionalities with role-based access control for voters and administrators.  

Integrated a **MySQL database** to manage users, candidates, and election results efficiently, ensuring data integrity and persistence. Implemented **real-time vote counting and result generation** with proper exception handling and input validation. Followed **clean coding practices and MVC architecture** to enhance maintainability and scalability of the system.
